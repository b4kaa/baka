  Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series, with several 
  characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as 
  minor characters or playable Legends. Work on the game began
   around late 2016, though the project remained a secret right
   up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a 
  surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that Respawn
   Entertainment was working on a third installment to the 
  Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major game. 
  Apex Legends received generally positive reviews from critics, 
  who praised its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of 
  elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy
   competitor to other battle royale games. Apex Legends 
  surpassed 25 million players by the end of its first week, 
  and 50 million within its first month. By April 2021, 
  it had approximately 100 million players making it one
   of the most played video games of all time by player count.
