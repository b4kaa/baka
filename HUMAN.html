        <p class="p1" align="justify">
         <font color="black" size="5px">The gameplay in Human: Fall Flat free is very interesting. There are some really creative puzzles, and some of them are really fun. There are also some really fun ways to die in this game. This is not a game for children, and it is full of dark humor. The controls in Human: Fall Flat download for PC are not the best, but the controls are not the worst either. I really think the game could have been a lot better if they had just added a little more detail to the controls.
